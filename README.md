# ðŸ§­ Spawn Cell Finder

Hello, all!

This is my **first ever programming project**, and Iâ€™m really excited to share it! ðŸš€  
I originally started building this app in Python, but the compiled version ended up being over 11MB, which felt too heavy. So, with a lot of help from AI (thanks, ChatGPT! ðŸ˜„), I rewrote it in **Rust** â€” and now it works like a charm.

## ðŸ›  What It Does

This simple tool helps you **find the nearest spawn cell** in a game. Just enter your current in-game coordinates, and the app will calculate the closest spawn point for you.

### âœ¨ Features

- Input your current location in-game
- App calculates the **nearest spawn cell position**
- Functional keyboard shortcuts:
  - `Enter` â€“ Confirm input
  - `Esc` â€“ Cancel or exit input

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To run the app:

1. [Download](#) or clone the repository
2. Build it using Rust:
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
